# Plant Classification with Lasagne/Theano

**Author** Ignacio Heredia

**Date** February 2017

This repository contains the code used to train a ResNet50 convolutional network on plant classification.

**Contents**
- `./data` Data files 
- `./scripts` Core code
- `./webpage` Independent folder which contains the indispensable files/functions to run a simple webpage to host your trained net and make predictions. The plant classification app is running at http://deep.ifca.es/.

This has been tested in Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7.12 with the Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit) distribution, Theano 0.9.0.dev2 and Lasagne 0.2.dev1.

## Resusing this framework
This framework is quite flexible to retrain a ResNet50 with your image dataset (in `.jpg` format). 

1) First you need add to the `./data/data_splits` path the files:
- `train.txt` *[mandatory]*
- `val.txt` *[optional]*
- `test.txt` *[optional]*
- `synsets.txt` *[mandatory]*

The `train.txt`, `val.txt` and `test.txt` files associate an image to a label number (that has to start at zero). The `synsets.txt` file translates those label numbers to label names. You can find examples of of these files at  `./data/data_splits/data_collections`.

You can choose to assign a tag to each training/validation data to perform a different data augmentation to each tag. However to define which data augmentation operations have to be performed to which tag, you have to manually modify the `data_augmentation` function in the `./data/data_utils.py` file. You can see for example how we performed an upside-down mirroring to all tags except *habit*.

2) You have to download the Lasagne Model Zoo pretrained weights with ImageNet from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lasagne/recipes/pretrained/imagenet/resnet50.pkl) and copy it to `./data/data_splits/pretrained_weights`.

3) Then you can launch the training executing `./scripts/train_runfile.py` once you have updated the parameters of the training inside the script (like the number of epochs, the data augmentation parameters, etc). If you want to train with gpu you should create a `.theanorc` file in your `~` dir with a content similar to the following:  
```
[global]
device=gpu
floatX=float32
[cuda] 
root = /usr/local/cuda-8.0
[lib]
cnmem=.75
```
The weights of the trained net will be stored in `./scripts/training_weights` and the training information in `./scripts/training_weights`. 

To learn how to use your freshly trained model for making predictions or plotting your training information, take a look at `./scripts/test_scripts/test_demo.py`. 
If you prefer to have a graphical interface, you can run a simple webpage in your localhost to make predictions. For that you have to copy:
- `synsets.txt` to `./webpage/model_files/data` 
- your trained weights `.npz` to `./webpage/model_files/training_weights`
- your training info `.json` to  `./webpage/model_files/training_info`

To launch the webpage from the terminal use the following commands:
```
cd ./webpage/webpage_files
export FLASK_APP=webpage_demo.py
python -m flask run
```
